Do you also love driving cars in Forza Horizon 5, but not the structure of the game itself?
Are you tired of the hamster wheel playlist, the mountain of mundane accolades, and your limitless resources from all those wheelspins?
If so, maybe this website can help you play the game in a more rewarding way!

In order to play, just pretend that your in-game garage and credits don't exist, and keep track of your cars and cash here instead.
Game progress should save automatically in your browser provided you're not in incognito mode, but there's also a feature to save and load your game in text form!
If you encounter any issues or have any questions, get in touch on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@sleepracer5124/featured) or discord!

I vow to not publish any changes to the site until 2023 at the earliest, and will inform upcoming changes in advance to those who I know are using this site.
If that doesn't include you, that's on you :).

# Rules (have to's)
* Set your in game difficulty so that you finish most races in position 2-6.
    * Winning occationally is good of course, but winning all the time isn't fun.
* Use the website to keep track of your cars and credits.
    * Don't use your other cars when playing career mode.
    * Don't spend more credits than the website says you have!
    * Use the upgrade buttons in the garage when buying new parts.
* Your DR (top right corner bar) dictates the maximum class of cars you're allowed to race.
* When doing a race, create a custom blueprint using the car list found in the info, and the rules from sharecode 886 102 069.
    * Because of the rules, the blueprint will require testing before publishing and running.
I recommend turning off drivatars and considering this a practice session.
    * Alternatively you could consider the blueprint testing to be the actual race, but keep in mind this will give you no in game progress!
* No restarts or rewinds, let whatever happens happen!


# Recommendations (can do's)
* Drive to your destinations rather than fast traveling!
Bring some purpose back to the open world and get yourself immersed.
    * Cockpit view recommended for cruises!
* Only change cars at your player house or festival sites.
    * Maybe even "store" your cars at the house, but work on them at a festival site?
Food for thought!
* If you feel that a crash would realistically not allow you to continute racing, retire from the race and report it as a DNF.
* Hide as many UI elements you are comfortable with (in particular skills/notifications)
* Make your own tunes and liveries!
All in the interest of getting yourself invested in your playthrough and your cars.

# Future plans
* Narrow down the scope of the game further. I'd love to hear ideas!
    * I want all cars to feel like they have a place here, and I think the way to achieve this is to exclude a large number of cars rather than add a million constellations/events.
        * Some hyper rare cars and meme cars don't really fit the "realism" thing this career mode is going for anyway.
        * This would also save me the hassle of having to update the car list every month...
    * I want to create a clear end goal, maybe in the form of a championship of sorts?
This would be at A class, maybe even S1 at most.
Other ideas welcome!
* Having to create, test and publish a blueprint for every race might be tedious.
But creating them all in advance as the game is structured right now is not feasible.
It might be after the scope narrowing though!
* I would LOVE to have the player race the same 11 characters throughout their career and have the opponent cars evolve along side them...
But the only way this would be possible as Forza works now, would be to create 11 new accounts for the opponents and have the player add them as friends. Not really feasible.
* Add the long races, they are currently not included.
    * Feel free to just race them for fun though, for now!
* Blueprint rules could include some method for ending the race as a DNF if enough damage has been taken
* Add event info button within the event as well.

# Known issues (don't abuse them lol)
* Tracks for single events and track lists for championships are re-rolled upon refreshing the page when in an event.
* Save data stored in plain text allows for manipulation.
    * This could possibly be a feature? Why limit?
