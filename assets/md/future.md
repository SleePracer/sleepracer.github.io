## Future plans

Here I'll try to summarize all my plans for the near and far future.
The ideas on this page are roughly sorted by when I'll work on implementing them, starting with things planned for the nearest future, working up towards what will probably mark the finished release of Career Mode.
I will add new ideas here as I get them, and I will remove items from this page as they are added to the game.


# Career restructure

I have only played through 0.2.0 once but I already have ideas and opinions on what to change!
These changes will most likely be rolled out one at a time.
First and foremost, it felt a bit short, I finished in about 12 hours myself.
The amount of showcases felt good, maybe a bit too high even, but I think it is important that the first showcase appears relatively early for the first time player to not lose interest.

It also felt short in the regard that I barely had enough money to upgrade my car to the top of each respective class.
I kept the starter car throughout just to see if it was feasible, but even then, I would not be able to afford a new car anyway.
Making the game longer by means of decreasing xp gain from events would mean that the player would gain more money per class.

In my playthrough, I failed the class advancement from B to A three times, and it was frustrating and not fun.
I don't want other players to experience that, but I also want it to feel like there's something extra at stake for the class advancements.
My current thinking is to change it to a more "fail forward" design, where the player gets a new car discount for finishing on the podium (in addition to the already twice as high prize money from the event).

The requirement to finish on podium to progress was removed in 0.2.2 as a hot fix.
It simply wasn't fun in practice.

I would also like to make the three advancements different events rather than the Colossus or Gauntlet three times.
Possibly endurance races, as I'll discuss a bit down below.


# Livery change button

While not enforced as a rule, changing liveries in career mode should cost the player some money.
To make this easier, I will add a button next to the upgrade button in the garage.
For now though, simply make a 5 000 upgrade to the same PI!


# Head-to-heads

When cruising between events in Horizon Solo, the drivatars can be challenged to a head-to-head.
I would like to encourage this by adding head-to-head win/lose buttons that would give/take a small amount of money, maybe 500.
This sounds abuseable so I'm thinking maybe it could be limited to once between events, but then again, this whole Career Mode is based on trusting players to impose limits on themselves, so I might be overthinking it.


# Endurance events

I love endurance events in old Gran Turismo games and would like to add something like that to Career Mode.
In my opinion, one hour is the sweet spot endurance race length, but even half hour races would probably be both fun and challenging.
Since I already plan on replacing the C and B class advancement events with something other than Colossus/Gauntlet, 30 minute endurance races seem like the natural choice for this, so that's probably what I'll do... probably.


# Rally events

Since real rally events are run as time trials essentially, it would be cool to have something like that in Career Mode.
It would be relatively easy to balance with a fixed car and tune, but would probably be more fun as a "bring your own car" type of event...
Could even have both tarmac and dirt rallies for both kinds of builds?
Some planning is needed though, so this will not happen in the nearest future.


# Custom drivatars

Imagine if, when playing Career Mode, every event would feature the same drivatars, driving the same car.
Rivals with cool names also driving rustboxes.
Maybe they'll even evolve alongside you, upgrading their rustboxes to racecars as you do.

In Forza Horizon 5, the only way I can see this working is to follow exactly 11 Xbox accounts like this on your Xbox account, and not be part of a club.
Also, you would have to make the 11 alt accounts with cool names and make sure they only have one rustbox in their garage.
What I'm saying is, it would be cool, but it would not be for everyone.
Players with less than 11 Xbox friends could get themselves a few rivals like this, but to take full advantage you would basically need to make a friendless alt account.

Even then, I will probably do this at some point, because I think it would be cool.
I've already made one rustbox account, McMillipede#8621, and getting to the point where the rustbox appeared as a drivatar only took about an hour.
So it's not complete madness, I've already spent countless hours on this project as is.


# Alternative starter cars

After playing Career Mode one or even more times, players might want to start the game with another rustbox from the roster.
This is simple enough to do with some save file trickery, but I would like to have it as an "advanced option" to pick freely between C or even D class starter rustboxes.
For now, if you want help getting a fresh game with another car, just let me know and I'll help out!


# Custom routes

While the base game tracks are fun, there are simply not enough of them.
But I also can't just add any custom route freely - in order to have the Rules of Play, the creator of the route must add them and share the blueprint.
I'd love to create some maps myself, and I probably will at some point, but this is not a priority for me at this moment.

If you have created custom routes that you think would fit Career Mode, contact me!
Here are some criteria the map would need to meet, although I reserve the right to deny maps for any other reason:
  * It has to be a circuit or a scramble, where one lap in an A800 has to be less than 2 minutes
  * It has to be moderately decorated, allowing all PCs and Xboxes to run it
  * It has to be drivatar friendly
      * This means that the driving line has to be drawn close to the race line, while keeping some distance from the edge of the track
      * It also means that there has to be as few dead stop points as possible
  * It has to be mainly featuring the pre-existing roads, although some limited custom road usage may be ok


# Undo button

It would be very nice to have a way to undo one or more things in Career Mode.
I don't know how I would implement it though, so it will require some tinkering, and will probably take time.
Not something I will prioritize right now.


# Scoring system

In the far future, I would maybe like this feature to signify the transition from Career Mode Beta to Release.
I've only given this a little bit of thought but wouldn't it be fun if at the end of the A class advancement, an overall score was given out to the playthrough?
Things like placing high in races, finishing special events and winning head-to-heads would give more points, and taking damage would probably give less.

This could also include some form of achievements - I'm not imagining anything like Forza Horizon 5 accolades or World of Warcraft achievements, but rather maybe something like the awards at the end of a round of TowerFall Ascension:
some highlights on what the player did extra good or different in the playthrough.

These are far future plans though, and I might even change my mind before we get to this point.
Still, I hope these ideas makes you excited for the future of Career Mode!
