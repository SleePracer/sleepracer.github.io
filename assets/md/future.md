<font size="6">Future plans</font>
<div style="margin-top: 15px"></div>

Here I'll try to summarize all my future plans for Career Mode.
The ideas on this page are sorted by when I'll work on implementing them.
I will add new ideas here as I get them, and I will remove items from this page as they are added to the game.

# Nitro

Nitro is something that we currently don't have in Forza Horizon, but we can add a scuffed version of it with the Rules of Play!
I can make the players engine torque temporarily double at the press of some button, and the amount of boost seems reasonable.
The scuffed bit is that there's no visual or auditory indication that you're going faster, so it doesn't **feel** as good as it does in other games.

Still, if there's ever going to be a Career Mode 1.1.0, it's most likely going to be Nitro.

# Rally events

Since real rally events are run as time trials essentially, it would be cool to have something like that in Career Mode.
It would be relatively easy to balance with a fixed car and tune, but would probably be more fun as a "bring your own car" type of event...
Could even have both tarmac and dirt rallies for both kinds of builds?
Some planning is needed though, so this will not happen in the nearest future.

# Custom drivatars

Imagine if, when playing Career Mode, every event would feature the same drivatars, driving the same car.
Rivals with cool names also driving rust buckets.
Maybe they'll even evolve alongside you, upgrading their rust buckets to racecars as you do.

In Forza Horizon 5, the only way I can see this working is to follow exactly 11 Xbox accounts like this on your Xbox account, and not be part of a club.
Also, you would have to make the 11 alt accounts with cool names and make sure they only have one rust bucket in their garage.
What I'm saying is, it would be cool, but it would not be for everyone.
Players with less than 11 Xbox friends could get themselves a few rivals like this, but to take full advantage you would basically need to make a friendless alt account.

Even then, I might do this at some point, because I think it would be cool.
I've already made one rust bucket account, McMillipede#8621, and getting to the point where the rust bucket appeared as a drivatar only took about an hour.
So it's not complete madness, I've already spent countless hours on this project as is.
