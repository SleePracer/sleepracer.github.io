<font size="6">Future plans</font>
<div style="margin-top: 15px"></div>

Here I'll try to summarize all my plans for the near and far future.
The ideas on this page are roughly sorted by when I'll work on implementing them, starting with things planned for the nearest future, working up towards what will probably mark the finished release of Career Mode.
I will add new ideas here as I get them, and I will remove items from this page as they are added to the game.

# Endurance events

I love endurance events in old Gran Turismo games and would like to add something like that to Career Mode.
In my opinion, one hour is the sweet spot endurance race length, but even half hour races would probably be both fun and challenging.


<div style="margin-top: 37px"></div>
# Rally events

Since real rally events are run as time trials essentially, it would be cool to have something like that in Career Mode.
It would be relatively easy to balance with a fixed car and tune, but would probably be more fun as a "bring your own car" type of event...
Could even have both tarmac and dirt rallies for both kinds of builds?
Some planning is needed though, so this will not happen in the nearest future.


<div style="margin-top: 37px"></div>
# Custom drivatars

Imagine if, when playing Career Mode, every event would feature the same drivatars, driving the same car.
Rivals with cool names also driving rust buckets.
Maybe they'll even evolve alongside you, upgrading their rust buckets to racecars as you do.

In Forza Horizon 5, the only way I can see this working is to follow exactly 11 Xbox accounts like this on your Xbox account, and not be part of a club.
Also, you would have to make the 11 alt accounts with cool names and make sure they only have one rust bucket in their garage.
What I'm saying is, it would be cool, but it would not be for everyone.
Players with less than 11 Xbox friends could get themselves a few rivals like this, but to take full advantage you would basically need to make a friendless alt account.

Even then, I will probably do this at some point, because I think it would be cool.
I've already made one rust bucket account, McMillipede#8621, and getting to the point where the rust bucket appeared as a drivatar only took about an hour.
So it's not complete madness, I've already spent countless hours on this project as is.

# Undo button

It would be very nice to have a way to undo one or more things in Career Mode.
I don't know how I would implement it though, so it will require some tinkering, and will probably take time.
Not something I will prioritize right now.


<div style="margin-top: 37px"></div>
# Scoring system

In the far future, I would maybe like this feature to signify the transition from Career Mode Beta to Release.
I've only given this a little bit of thought but wouldn't it be fun if at the end of the A class advancement, an overall score was given out to the playthrough?
Things like placing high in races, finishing special events and winning head-to-heads would give more points, and taking damage would probably give less.

This could also include some form of achievements - I'm not imagining anything like Forza Horizon 5 accolades or World of Warcraft achievements, but rather maybe something like the awards at the end of a round of TowerFall Ascension:
some highlights on what the player did extra good or different in the playthrough.

These are far future plans though, and I might even change my mind before we get to this point.
Still, I hope these ideas makes you excited for the future of Career Mode!
