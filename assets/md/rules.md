# What is this?

Do you also love driving in Forza Horizon 5, but not the structure of the game itself?
Are you tired of the hamster wheel playlist, the mountain of accolades, and your endless credits and cars from all those wheelspins?
If so, maybe this website can help you play the game in a more rewarding way!

In order to play, simply pretend that your in-game garage and credits don't exist, and keep track of your cars and cash here instead.
Start with your rust bucket of choice and progress through your career by racing specific blueprints in Forza Horizon 5.

# Rules (have to's)

  * Use the website to keep track of your cars and credits.
      * Don't use your other cars when playing career mode.
      * Don't spend more money than the website says you have!
  * Your Class is the maximum class of cars you're allowed to race.
      * It will increase as you progress, starting with C and ending with A!
  * Set the race difficulty appropriately.
      * This will require some trial and error, I suggest starting at 100%!
      * The game is balanced for finishing somewhere in the top 6 on average.
          * If you win, it might be set too low!
          * If you place 7th or lower, it might be set too high!
  * No restarts or rewinds, let whatever happens happen!

# Recommendations (can do's)

  * Drive to your destination instead of fast traveling.
Bring some purpose back to the open world and get yourself immersed!
      * Going Horizon Solo (offline) can make this more interesting!
  * Only change cars at your player house or festival sites.
  * Hide as many UI elements you are comfortable with.
      * The only thing you really need is "Lap Time and Position", to see your car damage!
  * Make your own tunes and liveries.
This will help you get invested in your playthrough!
  * Use cockpit view for extra immersion!

# Questions and Answers

  * What's so special about the blueprints? Why can't I just run vanilla Forza events?
      * The blueprint rules calculate damage based on collisions with drivatars and objects.
Damage is shown in the HUD info and the only thing you have to do is remember to check it before crossing the finish line, and entering it here after the race.
      * The rules also dynamically adjust torque/gravity based on positions and damage.
      * Additionally, the drivatars have changeable base torque and grip, detailed as "Difficulty" in the HUD info.

  * Why can't I buy my favourite Forza car in career mode?
      * In order to use the blueprint rules described above, I have to create my own blueprints for the races, and for these I have to define car categories.
      * I don't want to use "Anything goes" for the blueprints because drivatars will bring Peel P50s and Unimogs and whatnot.
      * I will also need to limit myself to one single category for this to be feasible, and the pre-defined categories aren't big and varied enough for this.
      * So I've used custom car restrictions, which is limited to 50 cars.
[The career mode roster](/roster) and eventlab restrictions are the same, so if you can buy a car on the website, you will always be able to use it for the blueprints!
