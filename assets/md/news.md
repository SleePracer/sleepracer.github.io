# Beta 0.2.1: News page

Introducing the "News" page, where I'll keep you up to date on the progress of Career Mode!
This will serve as a change log and maybe a blog, hopefully adding a bit of transparency to the project.
As I work on this sporadically, posts will also happen sporadically, depending on how much time I feel like spending on this hobby project of mine.

Any time there's a new post, the notification on the game page will be visible, and when you press the "Ok" button it will go away.
Adding this notification technically means a new version of the game, but only because I'm using the game state to keep track of whether it should be shown or hidden.
The game has no other updates with this version.

Next up I'll focus on things that should be easy to implement but will affect the game in a positive way:
  * Show cars of the current class and lower that the players can *not* afford in the buy car menu too
  * The decimal number for damage % on races is currently irrelevant, this is a bug, fix it
  * Make the money display red when player has negative money
  * More detailed documentation in the rules page, I'm imagining a wiki-like structure with some info that's currently only accessible by reading source code

That's all for now, thank you for reading!
