# Beta 0.3.1: New Special Events!

This update adds some new special events!
There's some new themed events, some region specific events, and some endurance events.

Since there's now a lot more to do, I've extended the game length a bit.
I've also changed when showcases appear and their payouts.

Happy racing!

# Beta 0.3.0: New Car Roster!

These five cars:
  * Audi Avant RS2 '95
  * Chevrolet Impala '96
  * HSV Maloo Ute '14
  * Lotus Elise '99
  * Vauxhall Corsa '16

have been replaced with these five cars:
  * Cadillac ATS-V '16
  * Lexus RC F '15
  * Lexus SC300 '97
  * Lotus Exige '12
  * Toyota Celica '03

I spend a little extra time making this change somewhat backwards compatible, the only real issue being players currently using the removed cars.
In such cases, they will automatically be sold, as they will not be useable for the new blueprints.
If you're using other cars, hopefully the transition should be seamless!

Next, now that the roster is in its final form, I will add some more special events.

Happy racing!

# Beta 0.2.6: New Special Event!

This update introduces another special event: Classic Muscle!
Players can bring the Camaro, Charger or Mustang to this event, but drivatars can also pick from a number of non-roster cars.
The Group A Touring and Rally events have also been updated to include a few non-roster cars for the drivatars to pick.
Also, I have changed the tracks to some fitting sprints not included elsewhere in Career Mode, since the Colossus and Gauntlet is already used for the final races.

For the next update I want to change the roster slightly.
This will mean updated sharecodes and will result in an **incompability with current game saves.**
To reflect this, the version number will go up to 0.3.0 (with the release being what will tick over to 1.0.0).
Therefore **I highly recommend wrapping up any playthroughs you have in progress before July!**
I promise to not release 0.3.0 before July 1st, but it might take even longer.

Happy racing!

# Beta 0.2.5: New Class Finales and Updated Showcases!

Hello, first update in a while because I've been busy with other things (RHEC, HTCC, TW), this one revamps and renames the class advancements to finales!
Instead of doing the Colossus or Gauntlet three times, players will do double length races around Muleg√© for C class, Guanajuato for B class and the Colossus or Gauntlet remains as the grand finale for A class.
The Colossus and Gauntlet races have also been slightly rebalanced to make up for drivatar quirks.

In addition, the Vintage Hatchbacks and Explorers showcases have been updated, since they had some issues before.
I'll keep the old blueprints and tunes shared for the time being.

Next on my to-do list is adding another special event.
I also plan on extending their rosters to include non-Career-Mode cars that the drivatars can use.

As the new Forza Motorsport draws near I realize that the already limited interest for Horizon 5 Career Mode will likely die off, since Motorsport hopefully has a satisfactory Career Mode in itself.
I will attempt to finalize the most important changes and release Career Mode before the Motorsport release.
But even then, we'll probably get a new Horizon in the future, and at that point this Career Mode might become relevant again.

Regardless, the future is bright!

# Beta 0.2.4: Head-to-Heads and Alternative Starters!

Added a "Head-to-Head" event with a 200 credit wager to encourage players to challenge drivatars to a Head-to-Head when cruising between events!
Winning gives 200 credits and losing removes 200 credits, xp is unaffected.
Just a small thing to help you get in the mood while playing!

Also, you can now pick other starter cars!
I limited the selection to "old" cars of mid C class and below.

Go challenge some drivatars!

# Beta 0.2.3: Discounts and Paint Button!

Class Advancements have changed to a more fail-forward approach:
podium is no longer needed to advance to the next class (since Beta 0.2.2),
but from Beta 0.2.3, getting podium rewards the player with a discount on their next car purchase!
All players already in B or A class will get the discounts regardless of their advancement race placements.
In addition, the prices of a few cars have been slightly modified, and [a chart of all 50 available cars](/roster) has been added!

Also, there's now a "Paint" button in the garage, that essentially does a 5 000 credit upgrade of your car to the same PI!
Just as for upgrades, the value is increased by half of that amount.
And the "Get in" button now only shows for the cars you're not already in.

That's all for this update!

# Beta 0.2.2: Updated Blueprints!

As I worked on adding switchable difficulty (and other things) to the Rules of Play, I realized that these updates were a massive improvement.
So I spent the weekend on getting the new rules finished, blueprints re-shared and sharecodes updated!
They are now live!
Here's a list of improvements:
  * Switchable difficulties (this is the big one!)
      * At the start of a race, you will have 10 seconds to press Activate or Rewind to increase or decrease the difficulty of the event!
  * Improved balancing
      * Difficulty now affects drivatar grip in addition to torque, and some light balancing between tracks has been applied!
  * Taking damage reduces your torque
      * In almost all events, your damage is divided by three and subtracted from your engine torque. Stay out of trouble!
  * Boost mode after checkpoint miss and car reset
      * A little extra help to get back in the race! Not big enough to be abuseable, but enough to soften the blow of a missed checkpoint!

Let me stress once again, that the game is balanced for you to place somewhere in the top 6 on average!
Winning every now and then is all good of course, but winning twice in a row probably means that the difficulty is set too low.
On the other end of the spectrum, if you just barely manage to finish in 6th and sometimes place even worse, the difficulty is set too high!
The steps should be granular enough to let you find a sweet spot.
Also note that when changing builds, cars or categories, your sweet spot difficulty might change!

In addition to this (in my opinion) massive improvement, I'm also going to remove the requirement to finish class advancement races in podium.
I failed several times and it was annoying, frustrating and not fun.
I'll replace it with some extra reward for podium instead, in the future, but this is a necessary hotfix for now.

Happy racing!

# QoL and Bugs

The things I mentioned in the previous post were indeed easy to implement, and are now live on the site!
New quality of life improvements are:
  * When browsing for new cars, unaffordable cars of your class and below are also visible
  * Showcase information now includes what track is raced
  * Negative money and unaffordable costs are now red

I've also fixed some bugs:
  * Decimal point for damage now affects repair cost as intended
  * Clicking the racing category again no longer changes what normal events are available
      * Switching between categories still does though!
  * Suggested repaint cost is now 5k on the Rules and Info page
      * Lowered from 10k after playtesting, although it I accidentally put it as 100k...

Next up should be general documentation improvements, but I've also started work in parallel on updating the blueprints!
If everything goes smoothly, the sharecodes will be updated next week, with:
  * Switchable difficulty
  * Improved balancing
  * Torque reduction from damage

Something to look forward to!

# Beta 0.2.1: News Page!

Introducing the "News" page, where I'll keep you up to date on the progress of Career Mode!
This will serve as a change log and maybe a blog, hopefully adding a bit of transparency to the project.
As I work on this sporadically, posts will also happen sporadically, depending on how much time I feel like spending on this hobby project of mine.

Any time there's a new post, the notification on the game page will be visible, and when you press the "Ok" button it will go away.
Adding this notification technically means a new version of the game, but only because I'm using the game state to keep track of whether it should be shown or hidden.
The game has no other updates with this version.

Next up I'll focus on things that should be easy to implement but will affect the game in a positive way:
  * Show cars of the current class and lower that the players can *not* afford in the buy car menu too
  * The decimal number for damage % on races is currently irrelevant, this is a bug, fix it
  * Make the money display red when player has negative money
  * More detailed documentation in the rules page, I'm imagining a wiki-like structure with some info that's currently only accessible by reading source code

That's all for now, thank you for reading!
