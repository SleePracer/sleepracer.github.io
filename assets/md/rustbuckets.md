Rust buckets play a significant part of Career Mode.
Not only are the available starter cars rust buckets, but rust buckets will also be available for purchase throughout the career.
So let's define them properly!

In Career Mode, a rust bucket is a car with:
  * A rusty or dirty looking livery, and
  * A roll cage installed!

Rust buckets can be converted into normal cars by painting them.
This restores some extra value, usually more than it costs, and lets you put a non-rusty livery on the car!
Keep the roll cage though!

So any time you start the game, or purchase a cheap rust bucket, you now know what to do!
