The Career Mode Showcase is an extra special Special Event, where the player gets to borrow a car from outside of the [Career Mode roster](/roster)!
To play these events, simply pick one of the cars detailed in the info and apply the tune!

These events generally make use of the remaining longer races in the game, and some event types that don't really fit Career Mode.
